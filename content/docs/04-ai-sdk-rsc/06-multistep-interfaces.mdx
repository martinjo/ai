# Designing Multistep Interfaces

Multistep interfaces refer to user interfaces that require multiple independent steps to be executed in order to complete a specific task.

In order to understand multistep interfaces, it is important to understand two concepts:

- Function composition
- Application context

**Function composition** is the process of combining multiple functions to create a new function. This is a powerful concept that allows you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

**Application context** refers to the state of the application at any given point in time. This includes the user's input, the output of the language model, and any other relevant information.

When designing multistep interfaces, you need to consider how the functions in your application can be composed together to form a coherent user experience as well as how the application context changes as the user progresses through the interface.

## Application Context

The application context can be thought of as the conversation history between the user and the language model. The richer the context, the more information the model has to generate relevant responses.

In the context of multistep interfaces, the application context becomes even more important. This is because **the user's input in one step may affect the output of the model in the next step**.

For example, consider a meal logging application that helps users track their daily food intake. The language model is provided with the following functions:

- `log_meal` takes in parameters like the name of the food, the quantity, and the time of consumption to log a meal.
- `delete_meal` takes in the name of the meal to be deleted.

When the user logs a meal, the model generates a response confirming the meal has been logged.

```txt highlight="2"
User: Log a chicken shawarma for lunch.
Function: log_meal("chicken shawarma", "250g", "12:00 PM")
Model: Chicken shawarma has been logged for lunch.
```

Now when the user decides to delete the meal, the model should be able to reference the previous step to identify the meal to be deleted.

```txt highlight="7"
User: Log a chicken shawarma for lunch.
Function: log_meal("chicken shawarma", "250g", "12:00 PM")
Model: Chicken shawarma has been logged for lunch.
...
...
User: I skipped lunch today, can you update my log?
Function: delete_meal("chicken shawarma")
Model: Chicken shawarma has been deleted from your log.
```

In this example, managing the application context is important for the model to generate the correct response. The model needs to have information about the previous actions in order for it to use generate the parameters for the `delete_meal` function.

## Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining multiple functions to create a new function. This involves defining the inputs and outputs of each function, as well as how they interact with each other.

The design of how these functions can be composed together to form a multistep interface is crucial to both the user experience of your application and the model's ability to generate the correct output.

For example, consider a flight booking assistant that can help users book flights. The assistant can be designed to have the following functions:

- `searchFlights`: Searches for flights based on the user's query.
- `lookupFlight`: Looks up details of a specific flight based on the flight number.
- `bookFlight`: Books a flight based on the user's selection.

The `searchFlights` function is called when the user wants to lookup flights for a specific route. This would typically mean the function should be able to take in parameters like the origin and destination of the flight.

The `lookupFlight` function is called when the user wants to get more details about a specific flight. This would typically mean the function should be able to take in parameters like the flight number and return information about seat availability.

The `bookFlight` function is called when the user decides to book a flight. In order to identify the flight to book, the function should be able to take in parameters like the flight number, trip date, and passenger details.

So the conversation between the user and the model could look like this:

```txt highlight="8"
User: I want to book a flight from New York to London.
Function: searchFlights("New York", "London")
Model: Here are the available flights from New York to London.
User: I want to book flight number BA123 on 12th December for myself and my wife.
Function: lookupFlight("BA123") -> "4 seats available"
Model: Sure, there are seats available! Can you provide the names of the passengers?
User: John Doe and Jane Doe.
Function: bookFlight("BA123", "12th December", ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"])
Model: Your flight has been booked!
```

In the last function call, the `bookFlight` function does not include passenger details as it is not available in the application context. As a result, it requests the user to provide the passenger details before proceeding with the booking.

Looking up passenger information could've been another function that the model could've called before calling the `bookFlight` function assuming that the user is logged into the application. This way, the model does not have to ask the user for the passenger details and can proceed with the booking.

```txt highlight="5,6"
User: I want to book a flight from New York to London.
Function: searchFlights("New York", "London")
Model: Here are the available flights from New York to London.
User: I want to book flight number BA123 on 12th December for myself an my wife.
Function: lookupContacts() -> ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"]
Function: bookFlight("BA123", "12th December", ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"])
Model: Your flight has been booked!
```

The `lookupContacts` function is called before the `bookFlight` function to ensure that the passenger details are available in the application context when booking the flight. This way, the model can reduce the number of steps required from the user and use its ability to call functions that populate its context and use that information to complete the booking process.

Now, let's introduce another function called `lookupBooking` that can be used to show booking details by taking in the name of the passenger as parameter. This function can be composed with the existing functions to provide a more complete user experience.

```txt highlight="2-4"
User: What's the status of my wife's upcoming flight?
Function: lookupContacts() -> ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"]
Function: lookupBooking("Jane Doe") -> "BA123 confirmed"
Function: lookupFlight("BA123") -> "Flight BA123 is scheduled to depart on 12th December."
Model: Your wife's flight BA123 is confirmed and scheduled to depart on 12th December.
```

In this example, the `lookupBooking` function is used to provide the user with the status of their wife's upcoming flight. By composing this function with the existing functions, the model is able to generate a response that includes the booking status and the departure date of the flight without requiring the user to provide additional information.

As a result, the more functions you design that can be composed together, the more complex and powerful your application can become.

## Implementation

The turn-by-turn implementation is the simplest form of multistep interfaces. In this implementation, the user and the model take turns during the conversation. For every user input, the model generates a response, and the conversation continues in this turn-by-turn fashion.

In the following example, we specify two tools `searchFlights` and `lookupFlight` that the model can use to search for flights and lookup details for a specific flight.

```tsx filename="actions.ts"
import { createAI, streamUI } from 'ai/rsc';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const searchFlights = async (
  source: string,
  destination: string,
  date: string,
) => {
  return [
    {
      id: '1',
      flightNumber: 'AA123',
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      flightNumber: 'AA456',
    },
  ];
};

const lookupFlight = async (flightNumber: string) => {
  return {
    flightNumber: flightNumber,
    departureTime: '10:00 AM',
    arrivalTime: '12:00 PM',
  };
};

export async function submitUserMessage(input: string) {
  'use server';

  const ui = await streamUI({
    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
    system: 'you are a flight booking assistant',
    prompt: input,
    text: async function ({ delta }) {
      return delta;
    },
    tools: {
      searchFlights: {
        description: 'search for flights',
        parameters: z.object({
          source: z.string().describe('The origin of the flight'),
          destination: z.string().describe('The destination of the flight'),
          date: z.string().describe('The date of the flight'),
        }),
        generate: async function* ({ source, destination, date }) {
          yield `Searching for flights from ${source} to ${destination} on ${date}...`;
          const results = await searchFlights(source, destination, date);

          return (
            <div>
              {results.map(result => (
                <div key={result.id}>
                  <div>{result.flightNumber}</div>
                </div>
              ))}
            </div>
          );
        },
      },
      lookupFlight: {
        description: 'lookup details for a flight',
        parameters: z.object({
          flightNumber: z.string().describe('The flight number'),
        }),
        generate: async function* ({ flightNumber }) {
          yield `Looking up details for flight ${flightNumber}...`;
          const details = await lookupFlight(flightNumber);

          return (
            <div>
              <div>{details.flightNumber}</div>
              <div>{details.departureTime}</div>
              <div>{details.arrivalTime}</div>
            </div>
          );
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return {
    display: ui.value,
  };
}

export const AI = createAI<any[], ReactNode[]>({
  initialUIState: [],
  initialAIState: [],
  actions: {
    submitUserMessage,
  },
});
```

During the conversation, you will notice that the model calls a tool for every user message. Since we're streaming user interfaces, it is possible to replace a user message with a user interaction, like a button click, to trigger the next step in the conversation.

To support user interactions, we will have to convert the component into a client component and use the `useAction` hook to trigger the next step in the conversation.

```tsx filename="components/flights.tsx"
'use client';

import { useActions, useUIState } from 'ai/rsc';
import { ReactNode } from 'react';

export const Flights = ({ results }: { results: any[] }) => {
  const { submitUserMessage } = useActions();
  const [, setMessages] = useUIState();

  return (
    <div>
      {results.map(result => (
        <div key={result.id}>
          <div
            onClick={async () => {
              const { display } = await submitUserMessage(
                `lookupFlight ${result.flightNumber}`,
              );

              setMessages((messages: ReactNode[]) => [...messages, display]);
            }}
          >
            {result.flightNumber}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

```tsx filename="actions.ts"
...
searchFlights: {
  description: 'search for flights',
  parameters: z.object({
    source: z.string().describe('The origin of the flight'),
    destination: z.string().describe('The destination of the flight'),
    date: z.string().describe('The date of the flight'),
  }),
  generate: async function* ({ source, destination, date }) {
    yield `Searching for flights from ${source} to ${destination} on ${date}...`;
    const results = await searchFlights(source, destination, date);

    return (<Flights results={results} />);
  },
}
...
```

In the above example, the `Flights` component is used to display the search results. When the user clicks on a flight number, the `lookupFlight` function is called with the flight number as a parameter. The `submitUserMessage` action is then called to trigger the next step in the conversation.
